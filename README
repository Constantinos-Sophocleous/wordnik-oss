Tools included:
com.wordnik.system.mongodb.SnapshotUtil

This is pretty straight forward, it's meant for taking backups of your data.  The differences between it and mongodump are:
* It splits files based on a configurable size
* It will let you select what you want to backup with inclusion and exclusion operators
* It will automatically gzip the files as it rotates them
* It supports a JSON export
* It runs a configurable thread pool so you can backup multiple collections simultaneously


com.wordnik.system.mongodb.RestoreUtil

Operates against either mongodump files or files made with the SnapshotUtil with either uncompressed or compressed bson files. Also supports inclusion/exclusion of files

com.wordnik.system.mongodb.IncrementalBackupUtil

This queries a master server's oplog and maintains a set of files which can be replayed against a snapshot of the database.  The procedure we use is to snapshot the db (either at the filesystem or with the tool) and apply the incremental changes created by this tool.
